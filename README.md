Game loads with first question and gif in place as well as a timer at the top counting down from 15 seconds. The player may choose one of the four question answers and click the 'next' button to proceed to the next slide. If the player does not click the 'next' button by the time the countdown reaches zero, the question will automatically move on and mark any unanswered questions as incorrect.

When the player reaches the last question they will be presented with a 'submit' button. Upon clicking 'submit' or the timer reacing zero, the results will be shown. The timer will switch to "Game Over" and a message will appear to tell the player how many questions they answered correctly.

The player can now go back and forth between the questions to see which ones they got right and which ones they got wrong. Wrong answers will be marked in red and correct answers will be marked in green. The 'submit' button is now replaced with a 'restart' button. 

By clicking on the 'restart' button, the player will be taken back to the first question and all answers and previous choices will be cleared.
